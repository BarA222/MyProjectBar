Consultants Management system:
This system deals with the management of consultants who advise companies.
The system allows consultants to view, create, update, delete all their appointments on a specific date they choose.
There are two kinds of users in the system:
1.	 A manager who can see all the consultants' meetings, can create new meetings, edit, and delete them on a specific date
2.	consultants can view their meetings on a specific date and see the customers.

To start the project, please do the following:

2.	Open the Nuget manager console 
3.	Set the default project on DAL project
4.	Run add-migartion
5.	Run update-database
After you finish the steps above, the ‘ConsultantsManagement’ DB should be created with the tables.
Now, you can run the project on ‘Client’:
